This file contains steps to solve the issue of " VM Agent Not Ready " for windows virtual machines ...

What is Azure VM Agent : 
------------------------

TAzure Virtual Machine Agent (VM Agent) is a secure, lightweight process that manages virtual machine (VM) interaction with the Azure Fabric Controller. The VM Agent has a primary role in enabling and executing Azure virtual machine extensions. VM Extensions enable post-deployment configuration of VM, such as installing and configuring software. VM extensions also enable recovery features such as resetting the administrative password of a VM. Without the Azure VM Agent, VM extensions cannot be run
 
Impact : 
--------

when the VM agent is in "Not Ready" state that will cause an issue with backup , extensions , administrative operations as mentioned above.

Troubleshooting Steps : 
-----------------------

I've followed all the steps mentioned in the offical documentation but it doesn't solve the issue in my case and while i was trying to install the agent in offline mode i faced the below error 

"Object doesn't support this property or method : 'Me.Script'"

---------------------------------------------------------------

Solution:
----------

>>> On the affected machine: 

1-Stop "Windows Azure Guest Agent" if it was running

2-Export then delete those registry in the path : 

 Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\WindowsAzureGuestAgent
 Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\rdagent

3-Backup then Remove

 C:\Windows\OEM\        "delete the conent of the OEM folder , don't delete the folder itself" 
 C:\Windows Azure       "delete the folder , and if it can't be deleted because it's used by the service you can restart the machine and then try to delete it again or rename it"

4-Open CMD as Admin and delete the service

 SC Delete "WindowsAzureGuestAgent"
 
5-Restart the server and check that the service deleted succesfully .
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>>> on a Working machine : 

1-Export the below registry : 

 Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\WindowsAzureGuestAgent
 Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\rdagent
	
and then copy them to the affected machine and install them

2- Copy the content of those folders to the affected machine in the same location (C:\Windows Azure  &  C:\Windows\OEM)

3-Create the "Windows Azure Guest Agent" again using powershell (run as administrator) by using the following command :

 New-Service -Name "WindowsAzureGuestAgent" -BinaryPathName C:\WindowsAzure\Packages\GuestAgent\WindowsAzureGuestAgent.exe

Finally go to Services to check that the service gets installed and then start it if it wasn't running and then restart the virtual machine , then check on the azure portal in 
the overview tab on the virtual machine blade and you'll find that the Agent Status is Ready ...

Note That : this solution is not official and doesn't exist in microsoft docs and it solved the issue in my case , SO please don't try this solution unless you've tried all the possible recommended solutions from the documentation with no result then you can give this a try and also i've tested this solution multiple times on different windows server versions and it worked normally .
