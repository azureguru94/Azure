What is Azure VM Agent : 
------------------------

The Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine Agent (VM Agent) is a secure, lightweight process that manages virtual machine (VM) interaction with the Azure Fabric Controller. The VM Agent has a primary role in enabling and executing Azure virtual machine extensions. VM Extensions enable post-deployment configuration of VM, such as installing and configuring software. VM extensions also enable recovery features such as resetting the administrative password of a VM. Without the Azure VM Agent, VM extensions cannot be run

 Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\rdagent

3-Backup then Remove

 C:\Windows\OEM\        "delete the conent of the OEM folder , don't delete the folder itself" 
 C:\Windows Azure       "delete the folder , and if it can't be deleted because it's used by the service you can restart the machine and then try to delete it again or rename it"

4-Open CMD as Admin and delete the service

 SC Delete "WindowsAzureGuestAgent"

	• Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\rdagent
	
and then copy them to the affected machine and install them

2- Copy the content of those folders to the affected machine in the same location (C:\Windows Azure  &  C:\Windows\OEM)

3-Create the "Windows Azure Guest Agent" again using powershell (run as administrator) by using the following command :

  New-Service -Name "WindowsAzureGuestAgent" -BinaryPathName C:\WindowsAzure\Packages\GuestAgent\WindowsAzureGuestAgent.exe

Finally go to Services to check that the service gets installed and then start it if it wasn't running and then restart the virtual machine , then check on the azure portal in 

the overview tab on the virtual machine blade and you'll find that the Agent Status is Ready
